<big><big><h2> What are emotional support animals</h2>

<p>An emotional support animal is an animal companion that offers some type of benefit to an individual with some form of disability. The animal is intended to provide companionship and support that will help alleviate at least one aspect of the disability.

Dogs are the most common type of emotional support animal, but cats are quite common as well. Other types of animals, such as miniature horses, can also serve as ESAs.<br>

For example, a peacock made headlines after it was denied from entering a United Airlines flight, despite the fact that its owner said that the animal was an emotional support animal. Some of the more unusual emotional support animals that have flown with their owners include a pig, a duck, a monkey, and a turkey. The vast majority of ESAs are not rare, exotic, or barnyard creatures.<br></p>

<h2>  What are service Dogs </h2>
<P>Service animals are working animals that have been trained to perform tasks that assist disabled people. Service animals may also be referred to as assistance animals, assist animals, or helper animals depending on the country and the animal's function.<br>

Dogs are the most common service animals, assisting people in many different ways since at least 1927.</P><hr>

<h2> Best Support Dogs </h2>
<ul>

<li> <h3> Golden Retriver </h3>
 <img src = "r.webp" class="img"></img>
<p class="p">Golden retrievers have long reigned as one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S., both as emotional support animals and general family pets. Their patient demeanors and overt friendliness make them a good fit for people with health issues. And as an added bonus, they are highly trainable.</p></li>



<li> <h3> Labrador Retriver </h3>
<img src="l.webp" class="img"></img>
<p class="p">Search any list of the best emotional support, therapy, or service dogs, and you’ll likely see Labrador retrievers. Labs are gentle and friendly with a strong desire to please. They're good for people who need a companion out of their homes, as Labs tend to be comfortable exploring the world.</p> </li>


<li> <h3> Cavalier King Charles Spaniel </h3>
<img src="cutedog.jpg" class="img"></img>
<p class="p">The Cavalier King Charles spaniel is like a living stuffed animal. These dogs love to cuddle and typically have a friendly temperament. They're often referred to as the “comforter spaniel.” They're usually just as happy to cozy up with their favorite humans as they are to join them for a pleasant walk.</p></li>

<li> <h3>German Shepherd</h3>
<img src="g.webp" class="img"></img>
<p class="p">German shepherds prefer to have a job, which is why they’re often chosen as working dogs. Their intelligence and eagerness to please also make them strong contenders as emotional support animals. Most German shepherds love to engage with their humans. And with sufficient training, they can become wonderful companions in public spaces.</p></li>

<li> <h3> Cats and other animals </h3>
<img src="C.JPG" class="img"></img>
<p class="p">If you are just not a dog person, you can make a cat into an emotional support animal. Cats can be loving and playful family members to their humans and even other animals. While they cannot be trained as a service animal, cats can become outstanding emotional support animals with housing and flying rights.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>  What are Shepherd dogs? </h2>
<P>Shepherd dogs are essentially herding dogs. But while all shepherd dogs are herding breeds, not all herding breeds are shepherd dogs. Confusing? That’s because shepherd dogs refer to a herding dog that specifically drives sheep.
<br>
For example, the Finnish Lapphund is one of the world’s top herding dogs. However, they’re are not technically a shepherd dog breed. In fact, the Finnish Lapphund was originally bred to herd the reindeer! Though, most others specialize in cattle.
<br>
That is not to say: cattle herders can’t herd sheep. In reality, many cattle dogs, such as the Blue Heeler, can and do herd both types of livestock. In many cases, a shepherd will evolve into a herder for cattle, ponies, fowl and more.
Dogs are the most common service animals, assisting people in many different ways since at least 1927.</P><hr>

<h2> Best Shepherd dogs</h2>
<ul>

<li> <h3> German Shepherd </h3>
 <img src = "r.webp" class="img"></img>
<p class="p"> The German Shepherd is certainly not known for sheep herding. Even so, that’s what they were originally bred for. They essentially had two jobs: drive the flocks and protect them. It’s largely why they make popular guard dogs today.
These dogs are descendants from old German herding dogs. However, the development of the German Shepherd is credited to a German officer, named Max von Stephanitz. He crossbred many variations of German herders, which ultimately led to the GSD.
The popularity of the German Shepherd skyrocketed in the 1990s, when these dogs first made headlines in Hollywood. With the growing popularity and fame of Rin-Tin-Tin and Strongheart the GSDs, people started to take notice.
<br>
Today, German Shepherds are known for a variety of work. They’re some of the most versatile dog breeds that far exceeds their expectations as just shepherd dogs. The GSD is famously known for police & military work, search and rescue, and more.
</p></li>



<li> <h3> Caucation Shepherd (Wolf Killer) </h3>
<p class="p"> While most believe that the Caucasian Shepherd originated from Russia, many countries have claimed this shepherd as their own. Throughout many generations, the Caucasian has made its way all over Eastern Europe – to Iran, Armenia, Turkey and more.
<br>
However, Caucasian Shepherds are not your “typical” sheepdogs. Sure, they did some herding work on the farm, but their primarily job was in protecting the sheep flocks. These huge dogs can reach 170 pounds, so the guard dog role perfectly suited them.

Size wasn’t all these dogs have going for them. They’re known to be fearless, brave and highly confident dogs. There were very few things that could scare a Caucasian. To top things off, the shepherd has extremely good hearing and sight.
<br>
They take their jobs seriously. But in the home, they’re soft and loving dogs that make a perfect family pet. The loyalty of these dogs are high and they’ll bravely protect all the members of the pack, including other dogs or pets.</p> </li>


<li> <h3> Kangal dogs </h3>
<p class="p"> The Kangal dog is a large and powerful ancient livestock guardian originally from the Sivas region in Turkey.

This dog has been selectively bred over hundreds of years primarily as a Turkish sheep guardian based on their size, strength, temperament and appearance.

They are also known as a Kangal Çöban Köpeği or Kangal Shepherd Dog

This guardian is a large and formidable working dog.

They are especially suited to working in pairs or team(s) to protect livestock from large predators (e.g. Foxes, Wolves and Bears). Because of this, they have a predictable and reliable temperament of being gentle with livestock and children and aggressive to predators.
<br>
They were historically bred by Turkish Shepherds, however, in the late 20th century the Kangal become popular in the US for their ability to guard sheep, goats and cattle.

He is best suited to an active working role in livestock guardianship on farms or freeholdings.</p></li>


<li> <h3> Dutch Shepherd </h3>
<p class="p"> One cannot deny the Dutch Shepherd’s eerie resemblance to America’s favorite shepherd, the GSD. In fact, it was so confusing that the breed standard changed so that Dutch Shepherds would only be brindle, thus making it easier to distinguish.

But unlike its German Shepherd cousins, the Dutch variety originated from The Netherlands, as given by their name. They were the perfect jack-of-all-trades shepherd that guarded farms and drove sheep. In the home, they would protect the kids too!
<br>
However, the popularity of the Dutch Shepherd as farm dogs didn’t last long. By the 1900s, the rise of industrialization took away most of the farm lands. Fortunately, the versatility and skills of these dogs made their transition in society smooth.

Dutch Shepherds, like the German Shepherds, evolved into police dogs, military assistants and search and rescue dogs. Today, many of them serve as affectionate guide dogs too. But even with all these new jobs, many Dutch Shepherds still herd in rural regions.</p></li>

<h2>Who is a motivational speaker?</h2>
<P>A motivational speaker, also known as an inspirational speaker, is someone who delivers speeches with the intention of motivating or inspiring the people in the audience. Typically, he or she has a reputation as an expert on the subject being discussed, and will encourage the audience to look at things from a different perspective and to become more attentive to their own talents and abilities.
The ultimate goal of a motivational speaker is to change people profoundly on an emotional and/or mental level, and to help them make some kind of professional or personal change in their lives and within themselves. People naturally tend to focus on all their problems, and the motivational speaker will help an audience to focus on the many opportunities instead, by using any number of persuasive speech tactics to inspire and motivate. </P>
